# Boilerplate React FE and Express BFF

Client bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Server bootstrapped with [Generate Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, run `yarn install` from the project root. This installs dependencies in both the `client/` and `api/` directories.

## Starting The App

Run `yarn start` in the `api/` directory, followed by `yarn start` in the `client/` directory (in different terminals).

Navigate to localhost:3000 to see the FE app. The BFF sits on localhost:9000.
